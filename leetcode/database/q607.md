where 用 s.sales_id 搜尋，來源也要給Sales_id來搜尋

錯誤示範
```SQL Server

select s.name from SalesPerson as S
where S.sales_id not in(
    select * from 
        Orders as O inner join Company as C
        on O.com_id = C.com_id
    where C.name = 'RED')
    
```
正確
```SQL Server

select s.name from SalesPerson as S
where S.sales_id not in(
    select O.sales_id from 
        Orders as O inner join Company as C
        on O.com_id = C.com_id
    where C.name = 'RED')
    
```
